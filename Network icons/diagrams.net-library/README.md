# QuISP icons as a diagrams.net library

[diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) (formerly draw.io) is a free online diagram software.

The file `quisp.xml` contains all the SVG icons in this repository bundled as a library that can be opened with diagrams.net (File -> Open Library...).

After opening the library, it appears as a set of _shapes_ than can be used in diagrams like the default ones shipped with the application.
